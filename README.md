# README

This is a simple website I created for a bubble tea shop as my capstone project. The main purpose is to serve as an online ordering platform for customers to order without having to queue in-store.

Visit jocha.pandan.dev for more info.

Users are able to 
- browse products by categories
- add products to the cart
- select different options and addons for selected products
- checkout using Braintree Sandbox (testing environment for payment)

Future improvements include:
- Points and rewards system. Allow users to sign in before making payment so that they can collect or spend points.
- Include links to social media, about us, career opportunities, etc.
